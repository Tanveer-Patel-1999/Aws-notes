Compute optimized instances
===========================
--> u have less time and do more work that time .
--> Compute optimized instances are ideal for "compute-bound" application that benefit for high performnace processor.

--> "compute-bound"  --> in one minute u process 1Lack request.
--> Compute optimized have " C-series".
--> "C-series" have --> C4 , C5 , C5n instances.

use cases
=========
1:Hight performnace Web server
2:Batch Processing
3:MMO Gaming
4:Video Encoding
