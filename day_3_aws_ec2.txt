EC2 : Elastic compute cloud
===  =======================
server = virtula machine = EC2 

"instance = virtula machine "


--> EC2 : Elastic compute cloud
--> Amzon provide scalable computing capacity in the aws cloud. (cpu,ram,hardisk)
--> Amzon EC2 enbale you to " scale up or scale down " the instance.
--> Amzon EC2 having two stroage option.
	1:EBS --> Elastic block store
	2:instance store --> it is fast as compare to EBS
--> PreConfigured template are available known as "Machin Image".[template = machine = server ]

Note importnat
--------------
	Q  --> there is limit of EC2 instance in region?
	Ans--> By default when you create an EC2 account with amazon , your account is limited to a " maximum of 
		20 instance per EC2 Region " with two defult High I/O instances.
		
Types Of EC2 instance
=====================
they are total 7 types
	
	1:General Purpose instances ---> Balanced Memory and CPU
	
	2:Compute Optimized instances --> More CPU than RAM
	
	3:Memory Optimized instances  --> More RAM
	
	4:Storage Optimized instances --> low latency stroage (DB instances)
	
	5:GPU / accerlerated computing instances --> Graphics optimzed (gaming purpose )
	
	6:High memory instances --> High RAM it is work on "Nitro system"--> [hypervisor]
	
	7:Previous Generation instance
