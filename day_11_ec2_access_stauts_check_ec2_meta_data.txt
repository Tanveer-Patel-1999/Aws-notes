EC2 Access ,Status check and EC2 Meta data
==========================================
EC2 Acess
---------
1: To access an instance you need a "key" and "key pair Name".[kay should be download ]
2: you can download the "Privte key " only once.
3: public key is saved by AWS to match it to the kay pair Name.
4: without key pair you can not aceess EC2 instances via " RDP or SSH (linux).
5: There is 20 EC2 instance soft limit per region 
6: You can submit a request to AWS to increase the EC2 instance limit.


EC2 Status check
----------------
--> It tell you your EC2 instance is in which state [Running , Panding , Terminate , stop ]
--> By default AWS EC2 service performs " Automated Status checks " every one minute.
--> Automated Status checks beacuse to verify any hardware and software issue.
--> Status check is inbuilt in AWS EC2 instance.
--> Ec2 Instancve send its " metric data " to "AWS cloudWatch" evry 5 minute.
	[ cloudWatch generally used for monitoring : It is by default present it monitor every 5 minute ]
--> If you monitoring every minute you Ec2 instance u have to pay for that.
--> If you stop Ec2 instance you dont pay for that you only pay for EBS storage.

they are two types of storage in root voulme
============================================

root voulme: where your OS placed
---------------------------------

1: EBS Backed EC2 Instance : root valume is EBS
2: Instance store Back EC2 : root valume Instance store Back


when you stop an EBS Backed Ec2 Instance
========================================
--> Instance is shutdown
--> state chnage from Running to Stop.
--> EBS voulme remain attached to the EC2 instance.
--> Any data catched in "RAM" or "instance store volume" is gone (remove)
--> Instance retain its private IPV4 or IPV6 address.
--> Instance release its public IPV4 address back to aws pool.
--> Instance retain its Elastic IP address.[Elastic IP : IP can not be changed it is fixed]


EC2 Instance Termination
========================
--> when you terminate a running instance the instance state changes as follow.
	Running --> Shutting Down --> Terminate
--> during the shutting down and terminate states you do not incur charges.
--> By default EBS Root devices voulme are deleted automatically when Ec2 instance are terminate.
--> Enable EC2 termination protection against accidental Termination.
 
 
EC2 Meta data
============
1: The information about Ec2 instance and Ec2 instance related information is called As EC2 Meta data.
exmp:
	IPV4 address, IPV6 address, DNS hostname, instance id, instance type, local hostname, public keys, security group.

2: Metadata can be only viewd from with in the instance. i.e you have to login to the instance. 
3: Metadata is not protection by encryption [ anyone that has aceess to the instance can view this data ] .
	GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/Metadata --> to check your metadata of your instance
	

Elastic Block Storage --> NAS
=====================
--> it is a NAS (network atached stroage) 
--> It is slow 
1: If your are using EBS as root volume then it is called as "  EBS Backed Instance".
2: we can replicated from one availibity zone to another availibity zone.[best used ]
3: EBS valume are deleted automatically when you terminate the instance.

Instance stroage --> DAS
================
--> it is a DAS (Direct atached stroage) 
--> It is faster as compare to EBS
-->  Physically attached to the host server.

--> data not lost when OS is rebort

--> data los when
	1: Underlying drive fails
	2:Instance is stop or terminate
