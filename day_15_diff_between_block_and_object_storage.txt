Differnce between Block and Object Storage
===========================================

Block level Storage : EBS : divides the data into blocks and store.
-------------------
1:Block level stroage is suitable for 
	"transectional databases" , "Structural databases ", random read/write load
2:"Block stroage divides the data to be stored in 'evenly sized blocks[data chunks ] for instance,

3: block stroage divides the data into "same sized of blocks" and stored into EBS.
4: "Data blocks" stored in "Block Storage" would not contain Metadata.
5: same sized of blocked (  "Data blocks" ) we have created have only indexing it does not have metadat.
6: Block Storage only keeps the address(indexing) of the Blocks it does not care
   what is present in the Block.
7: we can retrieve the Block using "index position"

examplec -> 5mb : 5 Blocks 
							1 Block : 1MB
							2 Block : 1MB
							3 Block : 1MB
							4 Block : 1MB
							5 Block : 1MB
							
--> 5 blocks have same size of data.

Object level Storage : S3
--------------------
1: object stroage store the file as it and does not divides them.
2: In Object Storage , on object is
	--> they are three types of Object
	1 : The file / data itself
	2 : Its metadat
	3 : Object Global unique ID.
	
--> The Object Global unique ID is a unique idetifier for the object.(can be the object name itself)
--> object name is unique because we can access from globally through internet.
--> we can access http and https through

example: DropBox, AWS S3 , facebook.
