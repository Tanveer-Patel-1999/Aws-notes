Services in cloud deployment module
===================================

Service module Or Services in cloud
-----------------------------------
--> cloud provides 3 types of services

1:IAAS --> Infrastructure as a servcie
2:PAAS --> Platform as a servcie
3:SAAS --> Software as a servcie

layer module
------------
				Application
				
				data
				
				Runtime
				
				Middleware
				
				OS
				
				Vitulization
				
				Server
				
				Storage
				
				Network
				

1:IAAS --> Infrastructure as a servcie --> haedware is part of infra
--> Network and Storage and Server access from cloud is called as infra.
--> any compnay can access "Network" to "OS" is called as an IAAS
				OS
				
				Vitulization
				
				Server
				
				Storage
				
				Network
				
				
2:PAAS --> Platform as a servcie
--> middleware and runtime is platform 
--> it is combimation of (IAAS + Runtime and middleware )
--> any compnay can access "Network" to "data" is called as an PAAS

3:SAAS --> Software as a servcie
--> it is combimation of (IAAS + PAAS + application )
--> any compnay can access "Network" to "application" is called as an PAAS

Deploymeny module of cloud
===========================
1: public Cloud
2: private Cloud
3: Hybrid Cloud
				
1: public Cloud
===============
--> awz ,azure, google are public cloud platform
--> any one create an account used there cloud.
--> It give every one to opturnites to make an "infra", run "services" on cloud.

2: private Cloud
================
--> it is called as an "interprise cloud".
--> A company can create an account for there used and these account can be used by company other branches.
--> It give "one-to-one" connectivity 
exmp
====
	Dell company --> company branches [ Mumbai,pune,banglore,hydrabad ]
	

3: Hybrid Cloud
===============

--> Azuer give best used of Hybrid Cloud
--> using this we can access "public and private cloud".


Vitulization
============
		
				Vitulization
				
				Server
				
				Storage
				
				Network
				
--> Network and Storage and Server you have to vitulize first
--> we can vitulizer using "hypervisor"

note
====
	--> first u have " infra " to make infra as "vitulize" then u make cloud.
	--> first step to make a cloud is vitulization.
	--> after making a vitulize next step u make a cloud.
	

--> AWS hypervisor name  ---> " citrix"
--> microsoft hybervisor name --> " hyper-v".
